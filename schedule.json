Some of this knowledge is nebulous, hindered by language barriers, and varies with an individual's background. What one knows as a tea drinker in the west, a tea drinker in the east, a merchant, a farmer growing it, all of them have differences.

Here I'll share what I've learned hiking the high cloud-shrouded mountains in Taiwan, in my pursuit to find good tea.",

Only a demon could have committed such a vile act, and they must have had minions to help them.\r\n\r\nIt falls to you, the villagers, to save the sleepy town of Ravenswood Bluff using logical deduction and social investigation alike. Good players learn information with their special abilities that will help them figure out who is suspicious... but watch out, because there are reasons why this information can be unreliable. Meanwhile, evil players will need to be clever, sowing misinformation and discord to protect the demon until the town is destroyed. Just remember... in Ravenswood Bluff, death is not the end.\r\n\r\nWe will be playing the beginner-friendly edition of Blood on the Clocktower called Trouble Brewing, with anywhere between 7 and 20 players welcome.

In this workshop we'll cover the breadth of experiences that can be derived from impact play, safety tools when approaching this kink, negotiation basics, common implements and much more. I will also be joined by Tiny Kitten Lia, an incredibly experienced bottom and general pervert.
