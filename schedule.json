      "description": "Join us for a screening of \"those\" cartoons - you know the ones. The Looney Tunes that stirred up uncanny desires you'd never felt before, and gave you uncomfortable feelings that didn\u2019t have a name. A loveless lovebird wants desperately to be swallowed whole by a voracious puddy tat. A potion is consumed, and a tiny mouse begins expanding his horizons. There are wolves in sheep\u2019s lingerie, bunnies beyond binaries, and bears under the thrall of mesmerizing emanations.  Do you remember the double-bind of Ferdie Fox\u2019s resurrection? Do you remember when existential fear first felt warm? \r\n\r\nTonight, the glow of the TV will be our full moon, as we unwind tight coils of 16mm film and VHS tape to unleash lost memories of transformative Saturday mornings. Your host Auryn will overshare stories from childhood while guiding you through the classic cartoons that launched a million kinks. This is where you came from, remember? \r\n\r\nAfter successfully corrupting America\u2019s precious youth at FWA and MFF, this new presentation for FC features permanent audience hypnosis, new HD transfers of rare films, a delicious homage to Laurie Anderson, and 300% more personal vulnerability! \r\n\r\nSo bring your sublimated desire and your PJs!",
